            <h1 style="color:teal;"> Why does canadian Obesity Rates Continue to Get Higher ?</h1>
          <p style="color:black; font-size: 1.3em; ">It is clearly noticed that: <br/>
            1- Males are more obese than females, a fact which is valid almost everytime. <br/>
            2- With growing in age comes an obesity chance increasment. <br/>
            3- The most obese province is NL (Newfounland & Labrador) which is also the least province in consuming  fruits and vegetables. <br/>
            4- The least obese province is BR (British Columbia), but it is not the highest province in consuming fruit and vegetables as there are larger provinces with more population.</p>
            <p style="color:black; font-size: 1.3em; ">In conclusion with less junk food consumption and more fruits and vegetables consumption  obesity levels can be lowered. <br/>
            In addition, males are in higher risk of obesity thereofre, canadian government should apply some encouragment programs to support sport practicing and healthy food marketing. <br/>
